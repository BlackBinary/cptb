# CPTB
CPTB is a trading bot for Coinbase Pro

## Requirements
CPTB requires the following dependencies to be installed:
* Redis server
* Node.js > V12.X

## Running CPTB
To run CPTB, clone or download this repository. Move inside the folder and run:

```
npm install
```

Copy the .env.example file to .env and edit the env file to match your Coinbase Pro API credentials

You should be good to go! But proceed with caution. Run CPTB in the following manner:

```
node cptb
```

The rest should be pretty self explainatory. If it's not, you should definetly stop right here and use another product, or wait for these docs to be updated.

Either way, good luck and have fun!

## Disclaimer
CPTB is built as an experiment by me, for me (Daen Rebel). There is nobody who should use this bot. Especially if you're unaware of what you're doing.
