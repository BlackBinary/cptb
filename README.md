# Pyramid Project
The Pyramid Project is a trading framework

## Requirements
Pyramid requires the following dependencies to be installed:
* Node.js > V12.X

## Running Pyramid
To run Pyramid, clone or download this repository. Move inside the folder and run:

```
npm install
```

Copy the .env.example file to .env and edit the env file to match your API credentials

You should be good to go! But proceed with caution. Run Pyramid in the following manner:

```
node pyramid
```

The rest should be pretty self explainatory. If it's not, you should definetly stop right here and use another product, or wait for these docs to be updated.

Either way, good luck and have fun!

## Disclaimer
Pyramid is built as an experiment. There is nobody who should use this framework, especially if you're unaware of what you're doing.
